### Problem Statement
Currently, if you need to extract diseases and treatments from free text, a trained person with clinical knowledge must manually look at the clinical notes and then pull this information.
A data entry team would manually look at the clinical text and extract information about diseases and their treatment data. A data validation team would validate the extracted information. This process is prone to errors, and as the data increases, the data-entry teamâ€™s size would need to be scaled up.
Automating this process would result in reduced man-hours. The data-entry team would not be required. The data validation team would still need to perform validation on extracted data. It would also significantly reduce manual errors.
